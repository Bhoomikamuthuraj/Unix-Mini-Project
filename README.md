# Unix-mini-project
Developed using shell scripting on the Ubuntu platform.
This beginner project aims at implementing an (offline) interface for the users to create a savings or current bank account, which is done by taking input from the users and stores it in the database file. 
Allows the user to check up on their deposits, withdrawals, and bank balance details by fetching the details from the database file.
